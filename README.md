## Predicting COVID-19 deaths

In the current project I developed a predictive model for the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. The main utilized method is Linear Regression. The observations represent countries at different points in time. The main explanatory variables are country-specific indicators such as GDP per capita, Median Age, etc. The presentation of the results is available in [BIO project.pdf](BIO%20project.pdf).
